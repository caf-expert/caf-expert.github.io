## Hackathon Details

### Part 1 - Whiteboard Design Session (WDS)

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at how to design an Azure migration for a heterogenous customer environment. The existing infrastructure comprises both Windows and Linux servers running on both VMware and physical machines and includes some legacy servers. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the various options and services available to migrate heterogenous environments to Azure.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and implement the discovery and assessment of environments to evaluate their readiness for migrating to Azure using services including Azure Migrate and Azure Database Migration Service.

### Part 2 - Hands-on Lab (HOL)

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to assess and migrate a multi-tier application from Hyper-V to Azure. You will learn how to use Azure Migrate as the hub for executing a migration, together with accompanying tools.

After this hands-on lab, you will know the role of Azure Migrate and related migration tools and how to use them to successfully migrate an on-premises multi-tier application to Azure.
